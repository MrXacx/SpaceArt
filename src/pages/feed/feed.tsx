              I spent 24 hours on 1 Coding Problem. Rotate Array was the first
              problem I tried on LeetCode. I spent the entire day trying to
              solve it but couldn't. I was extremely frustrated and went to the
              discussion section to read the most upvoted solution. Another 2
              hours passed and I could not even figure out why the solution
              works. At that point, my frustration had transformed into
              disappointment. I somehow managed to put myself to sleep that
              night. Next morning, I went to a friend and asked him to solve the
              exact same problem. And thatâ€™s when I learnt something really
              interesting about human behavior.
